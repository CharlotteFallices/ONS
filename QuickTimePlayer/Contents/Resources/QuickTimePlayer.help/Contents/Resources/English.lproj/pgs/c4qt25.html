				<h1>Creating Movies Optimized for iPhone and Web Delivery</h1>
			</div>
			<p>You can easily create versions of your movie that are optimized for iPhone and desktop viewing. This saves you several steps in creating movies for online distribution and ensures that your audience automatically receives the best viewing experience for the device they're using.</p>
			<p>To export for iPhone and web delivery:</p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li value="1">Choose File &gt; Export for Web.
				<li value="2">In the dialog that appears, specify a filename and select a location for the exported movies and HTML snippet file.
				<li value="3">Select the versions you want to create.
					<ul>
						<li>iPhone:   Creates a movie that is optimized for delivery to iPhone over a Wi-Fi connection.
						<li>iPhone (cellular):   Creates a move that is optimized for delivery to iPhone over a cellular (EDGE) connection.
						<li>Desktop:   Creates a movie optimized for delivery to computers over broadband connections.
					</ul>
				<li value="4">Choose a poster frame option for the movie.
					<p>The poster frame determines the still image viewers will see when they load the web page with the embedded reference movie. If you want to set a new poster frame before exporting the versions, click Cancel. Then navigate to the frame you want to use and choose View &gt; Set Poster Frame.</p>
				<li value="5">Click Export to create the files necessary for the options you selected.
					<p><a name="1016374"></a><font face=" ">The exporting process creates several files, including files for each version of the movie you select, a reference movie that will automatically deliver the correct version to the viewer, and an HTML file that contains a snippet of code you can use to embed the movie in a web page. All of these files must be copied to your web server, in the same location relative to each other and with the same file names, in order for the reference movie and HTML snippet to function correctly.</font></p>

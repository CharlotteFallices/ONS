				<h1>Viewing Movies at Full Screen</h1>
			</div>
			<p><a name="1012451"></a><font face=" ">You can set the screen so that only the movie is visible, not the QuickTime Player 7 window, desktop, or other windows. This presentation setting is called &quot;full-screen mode.&quot; (You can also set a movie to play at half size, double size, or other sizes.)</font></p>
			<h4><a name="1012453"></a><font color="#000000" face=" ">To play a movie at full screen, do one of the following:</font></h4>
			<ul>
				<li><a name="1012454"></a><font face=" ">Choose View &gt; Full Screen.</font>
				<li><a name="1012455"></a><font face=" ">Choose View &gt; Present Movie, choose Full Screen, and click Play.</font>
			</ul>
			<p><a name="1012456"></a><font face=" ">To quit full-screen mode, press Esc. To adjust the way the picture is sized to fit your screen, such as stretched to fit or in letterbox format, move the pointer to the top of the screen to display the QuickTime Player 7 menu options, and then choose a setting from the View menu. The following additional options are available in full-screen mode:</font></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a name="1012914"></a><font face=" ">Fit to Screen:  The content is scaled to fill your screen as fully as possible without cropping the movie or changing the aspect ratio.</font>
				<li><a name="1012922"></a><font face=" ">Zoom:  The content is scaled and cropped to completely fill your screen in at least one dimension. This can eliminate black areas on the top (letterboxing) or side (pillarboxing) but may hide or distort the content.</font>
				<li><a name="1012937"></a><font face=" ">Panoramic:  The content is scaled to fit your screen and the outer horizontal edges compressed to avoid cropping the image.</font>
			</ul>
			<p><a name="1012457"></a><font face=" ">You can also cycle through all of the available full-screen options by clicking the button in the movie controls that appear when you move the pointer.</font></p>
			<p><a name="1017349"></a><font face=" ">You can also set options for all movies playing at full screen. For example, you can hide the movie controls or change the amount of time they're displayed before being hidden. To set these options, see QuickTime Player 7 preferences.</font></p>
			<p><a name="1012458"></a><font face=" ">Note: As long as &quot;Display full-screen controls&quot; is selected in QuickTime Player 7 Preferences, you can make hidden controls appear by moving the pointer.</font></p>

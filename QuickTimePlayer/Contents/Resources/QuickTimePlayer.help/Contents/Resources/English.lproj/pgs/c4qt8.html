				<h1>Preparing a Movie for Fast Start</h1>
			</div>
			<p>You can set up a movie to start playing from a web server before the movie has completely downloaded to the user's hard disk. This is called a &quot;Fast Start&quot; movie.</p>
			<p>Set the Fast Start setting just before you distribute your movie; making other changes and resaving may undo the Fast Start setting.</p>
			<p>If the movie is in the format you want, you can set it up for Fast Start by choosing File &gt; Save As and then selecting &quot;Save as a self-contained movie.&quot; If the movie is not in the format you want, you need to encode it first by following the steps below.</p>
			<h4>To convert a movie and set it up for Fast Start:</h4>
			<ol type="1">
				<li value="1">In QuickTime Player 7, choose File &gt; Export.
				<li value="2">Choose &quot;Movie to QuickTime Movie&quot; from the Export pop-up menu.
				<li value="3">Click Options and select video and sound compression options appropriate for web delivery.
					<p>For more information, see <a href="c4qt3.html">Customizing Video Export Settings</a>, <a href="c4qt6.html">Customizing Sound Export Settings</a>.</p>
				<li value="4">Make sure the &quot;Prepare for Internet Streaming&quot; checkbox is selected and Fast Start appears in the pop-up menu.

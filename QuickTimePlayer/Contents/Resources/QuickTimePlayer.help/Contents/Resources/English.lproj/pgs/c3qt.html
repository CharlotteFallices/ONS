				<h1>Selecting and Playing Part of a Movie</h1>
			</div>
			<p><a name="1009556"></a>To perform editing functions such as Copy and Delete, in most cases you need to first select the desired portion of a movie. (If you don't select anything, the edit commands work on the current frame.)</p>
			<p><a name="1009557"></a>To select a portion of a movie, move the In and Out selection markers. The darkened area between the two markers indicates the selected portion. To fine-tune the selection, select a marker and move it with the arrow keys. You can also move the playhead and press I (for In) or O (for Out) to set the start or end point of the selection, even while the movie is playing.</p>
			<p><a name="1009576"></a>To play the selection, choose View &gt; Play Selection Only (so that the checkmark appears), then click Play. To play the whole movie, choose View &gt; Play Selection again (to remove the checkmark).</p>
			<p><a name="1009577"></a>You can save the movie (choose File &gt; Save) so that the next time it is opened, only the part you selected plays.</p>
			<p><a name="1009578"></a>Note: By default, the selection markers hide when nothing is selected, making it easy to determine whether or not a frame is selected. To turn off this option so that the selection markers appear even when nothing is selected, change the &quot;Hide selection indicators for empty selection&quot; option in QuickTime Player 7 preferences.</p>

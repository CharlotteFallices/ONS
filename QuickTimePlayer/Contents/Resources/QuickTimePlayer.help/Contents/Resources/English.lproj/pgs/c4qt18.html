				<h1>3G Audio Export Options</h1>
			</div>
			<p>When you export a movie to 3G format (by choosing File &gt; Export and then choosing &quot;Movie to 3G&quot;), you access the following options by clicking Options and then clicking Audio.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Audio Format:  If your source movie has only one audio track and it is already compressed, you can choose &quot;Pass through&quot; (so that the audio doesn't get compressed again).
				<li>Data Rate:  As with video, the more kilobits per second, the better the audio quality.
				<li>Channels:  Choose between mono (1 channel) or stereo (2 channels).
				<li>Frames per sample:  Available only with AMR audio, this option enables exported audio data to be packed more efficiently.
				<li>Silence detection:  Available only with AMR audio, this option detects audio portions with low signal levels and adjusts the data rate of the output accordingly.
				<li>Output Sample Rate:  Available only with AAC audio. It's best to match the sample rate to that of the target device.
				<li>Encoding Quality:  Available only with AAC audio. By choosing Best, you can get higher-quality audio but it takes longer to encode.
			</ul>

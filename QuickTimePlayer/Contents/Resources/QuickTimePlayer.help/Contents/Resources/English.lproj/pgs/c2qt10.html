				<h1>Creating a Slideshow or Animation from Still Images</h1>
			</div>
			<p><a name="1008895"></a>With QuickTime 7 Pro, you can combine a series of still images to create a movie that plays like a slideshow. This process is an easy way to share the pictures from your digital camera or mobile phone.</p>
			<p><a name="1008897"></a>Note: Slideshows look best when all the images are the same size.</p>
			<h4><a name="1008898"></a><font color="#000000" face=" ">To create a slideshow from still images:</font></h4>
			<ol type="1">
				<li value="1"><a name="1008899"></a>Put all the graphic files you want to include in a folder.
				<li value="2"><a name="1008900"></a>Name each file with the same name followed by an increasing number; for example, &quot;picture1,&quot; &quot;picture2.&quot;
					<p><a name="1008901"></a>Most digital cameras number files automatically. The numbers must be increasing but don't have to be precisely sequential (for example, you could name the files &quot;picture1,&quot; &quot;picture5,&quot; &quot;picture10,&quot; and so on).</p>
				<li value="3"><a name="1008903"></a>In QuickTime Player 7, choose File &gt; Open Image Sequence, and then select the first file.
				<li value="4"><a name="1008905"></a>Choose a frame rate (the number of frames displayed per second) from the Frame Rate pop-up menu.
					<p><a name="1008906"></a>Slideshows usually work best when slides are shown at 2 to 3 seconds per frame.</p>
					<p><a name="1008907"></a>QuickTime 7 Pro creates the movie, which shows each picture in sequence.</p>
				<li value="5"><a name="1008908"></a>Choose File &gt; Save to name and save the movie.
			</ol>
			<p><a name="1008909"></a>You can add music to your slideshow by adding an audio track to your movie before saving it. Open an audio file, select the portion you want to add to the slideshow, and choose Edit &gt; Copy. Select the slideshow (or a portion of it) and choose Edit &gt; Select All, then choose Edit &gt; &quot;Add to Selection and Scale.&quot; The audio is sped up or slowed down to fit the length of the paste destination (the pitch remains the same). For best results, make the slideshow length match that of the audio as closely as possible. You can also lengthen a soundtrack by adding multiple audio files to the movie, each beginning at a different point.</p>
			<p><a name="1008910"></a>Alternatively, you can keep the original audio speed and alter the image speed by opening a new player window, copying and pasting the audio into the new window, and then copying the slideshow and pasting it into the new window by choosing Edit &gt; &quot;Add to Selection and Scale.&quot;</p>

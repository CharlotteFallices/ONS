				<h1>Adding an Audio Track to a QuickTime Movie</h1>
			</div>
			<p><a name="1009671"></a>You can easily add audio and other tracks to a QuickTime movie.</p>
			<h4><a name="1009672"></a><font color="#000000" face=" ">To add an audio track to a movie:</font></h4>
			<ol type="1">
				<li value="1"><a name="1009673"></a>In QuickTime Player 7, choose File &gt; Open File and select the audio file you want to import.
				<li value="2"><a name="1009674"></a>In the QuickTime Player 7 window that opens, choose Edit &gt; Select All to select the entire audio file, then choose Edit &gt; Copy.
				<li value="3"><a name="1009675"></a>Open the movie to which you want to add the audio.
				<li value="4"><a name="1009676"></a>To add the audio to the whole movie, choose Edit &gt; Add. To add the audio to a part of the movie, select a part and choose Edit &gt; &quot;Add to Selection and Scale&quot;.
					<p><a name="1009677"></a>&quot;Add to Selection and Scale&quot; slows down or speeds up the audio track to fit the length of the selected part of the movie; the pitch remains the same (when you play the movie in QuickTime Player 7). You could add video to sound instead, and speed up or slow down the video to match the audio. You might have better results if you compare the timelines of the two tracks and cut from one or the other until they have the same duration.</p>
			</ol>
			<p><a name="1009678"></a>Note: If your audio and video are created by the same device, such as a DV camera, and are created at the same time, the audio and video will be synchronized.</p>

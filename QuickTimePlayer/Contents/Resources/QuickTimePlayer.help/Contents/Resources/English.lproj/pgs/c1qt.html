			</div>
			<p><a name="1009252"></a>You can use QuickTime Player 7 to play media stored on your computer's hard disk, a CD, a DVD, or the Internet.</p>
			<h4><a name="1009253"></a><font color="#000000" face=" ">To open a movie on your hard disk, a CD, or a DVD, do one of the following:</font></h4>
			<ul>
				<li><a name="1009272"></a>In the Finder, double-click the file or drag it to the QuickTime Player 7 application icon.
				<li><a name="1009273"></a>Choose File &gt; Open and select the file.
			</ul>
			<p><a name="1009280"></a>To open a movie on the Internet, open QuickTime Player 7, choose File &gt; Open URL, and enter the URL (the Internet address) for the movie file.</p>
			<p><a name="1009320"></a>QuickTime Player 7 has onscreen controls similar to those found on CD players and DVD players. Use the controls to play, pause, rewind, fast-forward, jump to the beginning or end, and adjust the volume of a QuickTime movie. You can also use the controls to move forward or backward in a movie.</p>
			<p><a name="1009322"></a>To go to a specific point in the movie, drag the playhead (the small black triangle) in the timeline. To step through frame-by-frame, first click the small black triangle and then press the Right or Left Arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>
			<p><a name="1009324"></a>Some movies have chapter lists you can use to jump to a specific point in a movie. If a movie has a chapter list, a pop-up menu appears between the timeline and the equalizer.</p>
			<p><a name="1009333"></a>You can drag the handle in the lower-right corner of the window to resize the viewing space.</p>

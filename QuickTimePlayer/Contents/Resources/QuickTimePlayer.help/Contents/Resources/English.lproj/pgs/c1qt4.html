			</div>
			<p><a name="1009510"></a>QTVR movies display three-dimensional places (panoramas) and objects with which the user can interact. With a QTVR panorama, it's as if you're standing in the scene and you can look around you up to 360 degrees in any direction. In a QTVR movie of an object, you can rotate the object in any direction.</p>
			<p><a name="1009529"></a>To pan through a QTVR movie, drag the cursor through the scene. To zoom in or out, click the + or - button. (If the buttons are not showing, zoom in by pressing Shift; zoom out by pressing Control.)</p>
			<p><a name="1009530"></a>Some QTVR movies have hot spots that take you from one scene (or node) to another. As you move the mouse over a hot spot, the cursor changes to an arrow. To see all the places where you can jump from one node in a scene to another, click the Show Hot Spot button (an arrow with a question mark in it). A translucent blue outline of any hot spots within the currently visible VR scene appears. (If there are no hot spots, clicking this button has no effect.) Click a hot spot to jump to a new scene.</p>
			<p><a name="1009531"></a>To step backward scene by scene, click the Back button. (The Back button appears only on QTVR movie windows, not in all QuickTime movie windows.)</p>
